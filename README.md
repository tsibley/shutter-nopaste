# Installation

    ln -sv Nopaste.pm /usr/share/shutter/resources/system/upload_plugins/upload/Nopaste.pm

# Configuration

You'll need to configure [App::Nopaste](https://metacpan.org/release/App-Nopaste) first to paste to a pastebin which accepts binary files.  I like to use my personal website + the SSH Nopaste plugin.
